# PowerPoint Stylizer for Tableau Exports

Transform bland Tableau PowerPoint exports into polished, on-brand presentationsâ€”automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

If you've ever exported dashboards from Tableau to PowerPoint, you know the pain:

- **Bland by default** â€” Tableau's native exports are functional but far from presentation-ready. No styling, no branding, just raw dashboard images.
- **Manual styling is tedious** â€” When you're exporting dozens of slides at once, manually adding titles, adjusting layouts, and applying brand guidelines can eat up hours.
- **Inconsistent results** â€” Hand-styling each slide often leads to inconsistent spacing, fonts, and formatting across your deck.

You need a way to batch-process your exports and make them look professional without the manual grind.

## âœ¨ What This Tool Does

**PowerPoint Stylizer** takes your Tableau-exported decks and automatically transforms them into polished, branded presentations.

### Key Features

ðŸŽ¨ **Batch Styling**  
Upload multiple PPTX files at once and apply consistent styling across all slides in seconds.

ðŸ¤– **Smart Title Extraction**  
Uses OCR to read the title directly from your dashboard image and adds it as proper slide textâ€”no more title-less slides.

ðŸŽ­ **Full Brand Control**  
Apply your template's theme, add rounded corners, drop shadows, custom fonts, and spacing. Everything is configurable.

ðŸ“¦ **Combine Multiple Decks**  
Merge several Tableau exports into a single presentation while maintaining consistent styling throughout.

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

![Process Overview](assets/Explainer.png)

1. **Upload your template** â€” Provide a branded PowerPoint template with your organization's theme and master slides
2. **Add Tableau exports** â€” Drop in one or more Tableau-exported PPTX files (order matters if you're combining multiple decks)
3. **Configure styling** â€” Adjust title formatting, image positioning, shadows, and other visual options
4. **Process & download** â€” Get a polished, professional presentation in seconds

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: On first run, the OCR engine will download language models (~100MB).*

### Web Interface

Run the Flask web app for an easy drag-and-drop interface:

```bash
python style_pptx_web.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

### Command Line

For scripting or batch processing, use the CLI:

```bash
python style_tableau_pptx.py \
  --input tableau_export.pptx \
  --template brand_template.pptx \
  --output styled_presentation.pptx \
  --title-case smart \
  --border-radius 10 \
  --shadow
```

### Options

- **Title Case** â€” Choose from smart, camel, upper, or lower case formatting
- **Image Positioning** â€” Control exactly where dashboard images appear on each slide
- **Shadows & Borders** â€” Add drop shadows with customizable color, blur, transparency, and angle
- **Rounded Corners** â€” Soften image edges with configurable border radius

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `python-pptx` â€” PowerPoint manipulation
- `Pillow` â€” Image processing
- `easyocr` â€” OCR for title extraction
- `Flask` â€” Web interface
- `werkzeug` â€” File upload handling

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Template matters** â€” Your template PPTX should have slide numbers enabled and your preferred theme/master slides configured
- **Reordering slides** â€” In the web interface, you can drag and drop input files to change their order
- **Title extraction** â€” OCR works best when Tableau dashboard titles are in the top-left corner with good contrast

## ðŸŽ¬ Example

See the `example_files/` directory for sample inputs and outputs demonstrating the transformation from a basic Tableau export to a fully styled presentation.
